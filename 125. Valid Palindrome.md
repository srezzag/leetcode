# Problem Statement
A phrase is a **palindrome** if, after converting all uppercase letters into lowercase letters and removing all non-alphanumeric characters, it reads the same forward and backward. Alphanumeric characters include letters and numbers.

Given a string `s`, return `true` *if it is a **palindrome***, or `false` otherwise.

# Approach 1 - Brute Force

My first approach consisted of lots using Regex patterns to catch Letter/Digit characters. I was not initially aware of the `isLetterOrDigit()` helper function that was available for use at the time.
```
class Solution {
    fun isPalindrome(s: String): Boolean {
        val filteredString = Regex("[^A-Za-z0-9]").replace(s, "").lowercase()
        return filteredString == filteredString.reversed()
    }
}
```
# Complexity
- Time complexity: $$O(4n)$$
- Space complexity: $$O(2n)$$
###### <!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

# Approach 2 - BUD Optimization

My second approach consisted of trying to do less iterations of the input string by being more wary of helper methods which take $$O(n)$$ time. 

For example, I'm now using `lowercase()` as I compare chars, in one iteration.

I also opted to leverage two pointers to utilize a sliding-window technique, which can help improve performance because it removes reliance on `reversed()`.

But I am still pre-filtering the data before comparing chars. This could be improved in a future approach.

```
class Solution {
    fun isPalindrome(s: String): Boolean {
        val filteredString = s.filter{char -> char.isLetterOrDigit()}
        if (filteredString.length < 2) return true
        var leftIndex = 0
        var rightIndex = filteredString.length - 1
        while(leftIndex < rightIndex){
            if(filteredString[leftIndex].lowercase() != filteredString[rightIndex].lowercase()) {
                return false
            }
            leftIndex++
            rightIndex--
        }
        return true
    }
}
```
# Complexity
- Time complexity: $$O(2n)$$
- Space complexity: $$O(2n)$$
###### <!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

# Approach 3 - More BUD + Short Circuiting

In this approach, I am still leveraging a sliding window technique with two pointers. However, I have gotten rid of the pre-filtering step and am now doing that within the `while` loops. 

In one iteration I am: validating `isLetterOrDigit()`, changing `toLowerCase()`, and doing the comparison without `reversed()`.

I also have done some short-circuiting logic optimization. 
If we're ever stepping into either of the `inner while` segments for a few non-alphanumeric characters, it may not matter which order we short-circuit in. But in the event that we have a long series of them, (or even if it's the entire string), the short circuit logic ordered this way would skip the `leftIndex < rightIndex` checks for each occurence of consecutive non-alphanumeric characters.
# Code
```
class Solution {
    fun isPalindrome(s: String): Boolean {
        var leftIndex = 0
        var rightIndex = s.length - 1
        while(leftIndex < rightIndex){
            while(!s[leftIndex].isLetterOrDigit() && leftIndex < rightIndex) leftIndex++
            while(!s[rightIndex].isLetterOrDigit() && leftIndex < rightIndex) rightIndex--
            if(s[leftIndex].toLowerCase() != s[rightIndex].toLowerCase()) {
                return false
            }
            leftIndex++
            rightIndex--
        }
        return true
    }
}
```
