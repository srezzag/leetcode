# Problem Statement
Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return **indices** of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.

You may assume that each input would have ***exactly one*** solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

# Constraints
- `2 <= nums.length <= 10^4` // nums can be size 10,000
- `10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9` // values can range from [-1billion, +1billion]
- `10^9 <= target <= 10^9` // target can range from [-1billion, +1billion]
- Only one valid answer exists.

# Clarifying Ambiguties
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
To me, everything seemed straightforward, until I found myself making assumptions about the data. There are a few requirements I wanted to know upfront, prior to writing a solution. These pieces of information are unclear from the problem statement description.

> You may not use the same element twice.

Ex1. I *assume* this means if I had `nums = [1,2,5], target = 4` I can not use the solution of returning `indices [1,1] or values [2,2]`. (Reusing the same element twice).

Ex2. I was curious about `nums = [2,3,3,5], target = 6`, if I could return `indices [1,2] or values [3,3]` to reach `target = 6.` Is `element` referring to the indices or values? 

I came to find out via test cases, that Ex1. is indeed an invalid input, but Ex2. is fair game.

# Approach 1 - Brute Force
My first idea was to just brute force a solution by iterating through `nums`. This would allow me to accomplish three things:

1. Have *a* solution that could hopefully and eventually complete.
2. Better understand the nature of the problem.
3. Identify bottlenecks, unecessary work, duplicate work.

This was my Brute Force Solution:
```
class Solution {
    fun twoSum(nums: IntArray, target: Int): IntArray {
        for (i in 0 until nums.size - 1) {
            for (j in i + 1 until nums.size) {
                if (nums[i] + nums[j] == target) {
                    return intArrayOf(i, j)
                }
            }
        }
        throw IllegalArgumentException("No solution found")
    }
}
```

# Approach 2 - BUD Optimization

- Bottleneck - The largest bottleneck I'm currently facing is that I must iterate over `nums` multiple times to reach the `target`. I should try finding a solution that only takes one passthrough of `nums`

- Unecessary Work - Same as the bottleneck. It may be unecessary to iterate multiple times over `nums`.

- Duplicate Work - With a double for-loop, I may be checking the same two values in reverse order, which will not yield a different result. Ex: 2 + 3 == 3 + 2.


My approch this time was to keep my two pointers, but to instead walk the pointers from opposite ends and meet in the middle. This approach will incrementally move one pointer at a time based on if the two pointers are above or below the target.

Sadly, this solution falls short if provided with an array that is not sorted. Furthermore, taking time to pre-calculate the sorted version also falls short because you lose track of the original indices after sorting.

Ex. `nums = [3,2,1]` --sort--> `nums = [1,2,3]`
If `target = 5`, we expect `[0,1]`, not `[1,2]`.

This was my Double-Pointer Solution:
```
class Solution {
    fun twoSum(nums: IntArray, target: Int): IntArray {
        var leftIndex = 0
        var rightIndex = nums.size - 1
        while (leftIndex < rightIndex) {
            if (target == nums[leftIndex] + nums[rightIndex]) {
                return intArrayOf(leftIndex, rightIndex)
            } else if (target < nums[leftIndex] + nums[rightIndex]) {
                rightIndex--
            } else {
                leftIndex++
            }
        }
        return intArrayOf()
    }
}
```

# Approach 3 - Data Structures & Trade-Offs

The issue with the previous approach is that we put too much emphasis on needing a sorted input. The lack of which, means we need to track original indices. Perhaps we could trade-off our O(1) space complexity for an O(n) time complexity (or better), and which can handle unsorted inputs.

My thought process here is to ingest all of `nums` and convert it from an array to a map. 

One big question in my mind is -- "What should my key value pairs be?"
It will probably be whatever I need to query by. 

Since I'm iterating with only one-pointer now, perhaps my query will be for the complement to my pointer's value. Therefore, my map <K,V> should be of type <Int,Int>, where I will store <Value, Index>.

However -- there is one issue with this code, can you spot it?

This was my Single-Pointer Solution with a Map:
```
class Solution {
    fun twoSum(nums: IntArray, target: Int): IntArray {
        val map = nums.mapIndexed { index, value -> value to index }.toMap()
        nums.forEachIndexed { index, value ->
            if (map.containsKey(target - value)) {
                return intArrayOf(index, map[target - value]!!)
            }
        }
        return intArrayOf()
    }
}
```

This solution failed on the input `[3,2,4]`, where it returned `[0,0]` instead of `[1,2]`. Our map is violating a requirement of not re-using the same element twice.

Initially, one might think of adding a check such as this:
```
if (map.containsKey(target - value) && target - value != value)
```
to ensure we aren't re-using the same element twice. One thing to remember here is to not conflate `element` with `value`. Because although the logic above would handle the input `[3,2,4]`, it would fail on `[3,3]`, where we have two differement *`elements`*, but they have the same value. 

Given that our map is keyed off value, how do we map two different indicies, to the same input? Well if we think intuitively enough, we don't have to! 

If our `target = 6`, and we have `[3,3,x,...n]`, and only one solution exists, we'll return the index of the map and the index of our pointer simultaneously when we reach this step.

Otherwise, if our `target` isn't the sum of two duplicates, then it is *impossible* for either of them to be apart of the final sum, because if only solution exists (a pair of indices), we can't be in a state where there's two valid indicies for the same value.

Ex: `nums = [1,2,3,3], target = 5`
Valid answers would be: `[1,2]` and `[1,3]`. 
Therefore, we can confidently say that unless we hit our target with a pair of values, we can disregard their indicies, and overwrite them in our map.

In order to detect the scenario of when we might have a pair of values as our answer, we must calculate against our `target` upon insertion to our map.

This actually leads to a **time complexity optimization**. As we check complement values while populating our map, we avoid having to populate the entire map with unecessary values in the event our answer is in the first few elements. 

Furthermore, we can instead store the complement value in the index as we move through `nums`, so that when we do reach our complement value, we can return immediately and prevent an additional calculation.

# Code
```
class Solution {
    fun twoSum(nums: IntArray, target: Int): IntArray {
        val map = mutableMapOf<Int, Int>()
        nums.forEachIndexed { index, int -> 
            map[int]?.let { return intArrayOf(it, index) }
            map[target - int] = index   
        }
        throw IllegalStateException("no solution found")
    }
}
```
